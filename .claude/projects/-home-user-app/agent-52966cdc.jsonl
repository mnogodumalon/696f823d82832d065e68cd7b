The workflow emphasizes designing first (creating design_brief.md) and then implementing (creating Dashboard.tsx).\n\nWhat requirements would you like me to help plan for? Please share:\n1. The user's request or feature requirements\n2. Any specific perspective you'd like me to apply to the design process (e.g., performance-focused, accessibility-first, mobile-first, etc.)\n\nI'll then explore the codebase thoroughly and provide you with a detailed implementation plan, including the critical files needed for implementation."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2103,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2103,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXLUGB4yg2k4YwijCAcJj","type":"assistant","uuid":"76b00e41-aedc-4eb8-a093-11d958ae621f","timestamp":"2026-01-21T11:48:39.011Z"}
