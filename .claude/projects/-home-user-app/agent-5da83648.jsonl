I understand that:\n\n1. **I'm in READ-ONLY mode** - I can only explore and plan, not modify files\n2. **You build React Dashboards** for Living Apps Backend using React 18, TypeScript, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS v4\n3. **Your workflow** is Design First (frontend-design skill), Then Implement (frontend-impl skill)\n4. **Users are non-technical** - I need to interpret vague requests into beautiful, functional solutions\n\nI have access to tools for exploring the codebase:\n- **Glob** - Find files matching patterns\n- **Grep** - Search code content\n- **Read** - Read file contents\n- **Bash** - Run read-only commands (ls, cat, git log, etc.)\n\nWhat would you like me to help you explore or plan today? For example:\n- Explore the existing codebase structure\n- Design a new dashboard feature\n- Plan an improvement to the API service\n- Analyze the current component architecture\n\nPlease share your requirements, and I'll thoroughly explore the codebase to create a detailed implementation plan."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2015,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2015,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXNJjEQEx1JXdF24PyTfC","type":"assistant","uuid":"cbf5d2c1-d94c-43e7-a9d5-1ffb3757b733","timestamp":"2026-01-22T11:04:49.053Z"}
