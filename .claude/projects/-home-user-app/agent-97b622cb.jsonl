I understand that:\n\n1. I'm in READ-ONLY mode - I can only search, read, and analyze files\n2. I cannot create, modify, delete, or move any files\n3. I have access to powerful search tools (Glob, Grep, Read, Bash for read-only operations)\n4. The project is a React 18 + TypeScript dashboard builder using shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, and recharts\n5. The key workflow is: Understand → Analyze → Design → Implement → Build & Deploy\n\nI'm familiar with the project structure including:\n- `/src/types/` for TypeScript types\n- `/src/services/livingAppsService.ts` for API interactions\n- `/src/components/ui/` for shadcn UI components\n- `app_metadata.json` for app metadata\n- `.claude/skills/` for design and implementation guidelines\n\nI'm all set to efficiently search through your codebase, locate specific files, analyze code patterns, and provide insights.
