I'm ready to help you explore codebases and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see this is a Living Apps Dashboard Generator project built with React 18 + TypeScript, using shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS v4, and recharts. The project follows a structured workflow where I should design first (using frontend-design skill) and then implement (using frontend-impl skill).\n\nI'm currently in READ-ONLY planning mode, which means I can:\n- Explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, Read, and Bash (read-only operations)\n- Analyze the architecture and existing patterns\n- Design implementation plans\n- Provide detailed step-by-step strategies\n\nI CANNOT:\n- Create, modify, or delete any files\n- Run any commands that change system state\n- Use file editing tools\n\nWhat would you like me to help you with? Are you looking to:\n1. Explore the current codebase structure?\n2. Design a new dashboard feature?\n3. Analyze existing patterns for a specific implementation?\n4. Plan out a technical approach for new requirements?\n\nPlease share your requirements and I'll thoroughly explore the codebase to create a detailed implementation plan for you."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2075,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2075,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXNeEzgY4SbL5KJDLCVuU","type":"assistant","uuid":"abbdf8ea-46c6-4d0b-a17e-4a4f6b5e9ab6","timestamp":"2026-01-22T15:20:42.260Z"}
