I understand that:\n\n1. **My users are NOT developers** - they'll give simple, vague requests that I need to interpret into beautiful, functional dashboards\n2. **I must follow a strict workflow**: Design First (using frontend-design skill), Then Implement (using frontend-impl skill)\n3. **Critical constraints**:\n   - Work with existing Living Apps REST API\n   - Follow specific date formatting and API rules\n   - Use the tech stack: React 18 + TypeScript, shadcn/ui, Tailwind v4, recharts\n   - Never recreate existing files (types, services, UI components, app_metadata.json)\n\nI'm in **READ-ONLY planning mode** right now, which means I can:\n- ✅ Explore the codebase (Glob, Grep, Read, Bash for read-only operations)\n- ✅ Understand the architecture and existing patterns\n- ✅ Design implementation plans\n- ❌ NOT create, modify, or delete any files\n\nWhat dashboard would you like me to help you build? Share your requirements and I'll explore the codebase, understand your Living Apps data structure, and create a detailed implementation plan."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1760,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1760,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXLg7ww84pb3CcaGYortx","type":"assistant","uuid":"1cdb78fe-c178-48d6-987e-74e379ebf8de","timestamp":"2026-01-21T14:24:11.207Z"}
