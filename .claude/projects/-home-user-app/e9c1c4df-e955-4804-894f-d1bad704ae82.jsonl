Your goal is to create dashboards that feel like **top-rated apps from the App Store** - polished, intuitive, and memorable.\n\nYour output is `design_brief.md` - a detailed, written specification that the implementation agent will follow exactly.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Why Markdown, Not JSON\n\nYou write a **design brief** in Markdown because:\n\n1. **Explains WHY** - You can explain your reasoning, which helps the implementer understand intent\n2. **Reads as instructions** - The implementer treats it as guidance, not just data\n3. **Allows nuance** - You can describe visual details that don't fit in JSON fields\n4. **Prevents misinterpretation** - Explicit descriptions leave no room for \"creative interpretation\"\n\n---\n\n## Design Standard: App Store Quality\n\nYour designs must meet the quality bar of **the best apps in the App Store**:\n\n- **Layouts that feel native** to each device (not just \"responsive\")\n- **Information architecture** that makes sense instantly\n- **Touch targets and interactions** designed for each platform\n- **Visual hierarchy** that guides the eye naturally\n- **Distinctive details** that make the app memorable\n\nAsk yourself: **\"Would Apple feature this in the App Store?\"** If no, redesign.\n\n---\n\n## Theme: Light, Minimal, BUT Distinctive\n\n**Always use light mode.** But minimal does NOT mean generic or boring.\n\n### The Balance\n\n- **Minimalist** - Every element has a purpose, no clutter\n- **Modern** - Clean lines, subtle shadows, refined typography\n- **Neutral** - Calm, professional base\n- **BUT Distinctive** - One or two memorable details that make it special\n\n### What Makes a Minimal Design Distinctive?\n\nGreat minimal apps have subtle touches that create personality:\n\n1. **A refined color accent** - Not generic blue, but a carefully chosen tone\n2. **Thoughtful typography** - Font weight, size, and spacing that feels considered\n3. **Subtle texture or depth** - Light gradients, gentle shadows, or background patterns\n4. **Micro-details** - Icon style, border radius, spacing rhythm\n5. **Intentional white space** - Not just \"empty\" but compositionally balanced\n\n### Color Philosophy for Light Theme\n\nStart with a warm or cool base, not pure white:\n- **Warm base**: Off-white with slight cream/yellow undertone\n- **Cool base**: Off-white with slight blue/gray undertone\n\nThen add ONE carefully chosen accent color:\n- Not generic blue (#007bff) or green (#28a745)\n- Pick a specific, refined tone that fits the app's domain\n- Use sparingly - accent highlights important elements\n\n### Typography Philosophy\n\n**FORBIDDEN FONTS:** Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, Arial, Helvetica, system-ui\n\nThese fonts are so common they signal \"no design thought went into this.\"\n\n**Choose fonts that add character while remaining readable:**\n\n| App Character | Recommended Fonts |\n|--------------|-------------------|\n| Data/Analytics | Space Grotesk, IBM Plex Sans, Geist |\n| Fitness/Health | Outfit, Nunito Sans, DM Sans |\n| Finance | Source Serif 4, Newsreader, IBM Plex Serif |\n| Creative | Syne, Bricolage Grotesque, Cabinet Grotesk |\n| Professional | Source Sans 3, Plus Jakarta Sans, Manrope |\n\n**Typography creates hierarchy through:**\n- Extreme weight differences (300 vs 700, not 400 vs 500)\n- Size jumps (24px vs 14px, not 16px vs 14px)\n- Careful letter-spacing adjustments\n\n---\n\n## Layout Design (MOST IMPORTANT!)\n\nLayout is the foundation of good UX. Spend the most time here.\n\n**⚠️ The #1 reason dashboards look like \"AI slop\" is a boring, symmetrical grid layout.** Real designers create visual tension and flow. Your layout must feel hand-crafted by a senior product designer for THIS specific app.\n\n### Think Like a Product Designer\n\nBefore drawing anything, answer:\n\n1. **What is the ONE thing users must see first?**\n   - This becomes your hero element - the visual anchor\n   - Everything else supports this\n\n2. **What actions do users take most often?**\n   - The #1 action becomes your Primary Action Button (REQUIRED!)\n   - Maximum 1-2 taps/clicks to reach\n   - Position for thumb reach on mobile\n   - This dashboard is interactive, NOT read-only!\n\n3. **What is the user's mental model?**\n   - How do they naturally think about this data?\n   - Your layout should mirror their thinking\n\n4. **What is the user's workflow?**\n   - What sequence of actions do they take?\n   - How can the layout support this flow?\n\n---\n\n### Creating Visual Interest\n\nThe goal is a layout that feels **intentionally designed for THIS app**, not a generic template.\n\n**The core principle:** Every layout needs at least ONE element that creates visual interest - something that breaks the monotony of identical boxes. This could be:\n\n- **Size variation** - One element noticeably larger than others (the hero)\n- **Weight variation** - Mix of bold and subtle elements\n- **Spacing variation** - Tighter grouping within sections, more space between\n- **Format variation** - Mix of cards, inline text, badges (not everything in cards)\n- **Typography variation** - Different sizes that create clear hierarchy\n\n### Symmetric vs Asymmetric Layouts\n\n**Both can work well.** Choose based on what suits the app:\n\n**Symmetric layouts work when:**\n- The app has 2-4 equally important metrics\n- The data is naturally balanced (e.g., income vs expenses)\n- A calm, orderly feel fits the app's purpose\n\n**Asymmetric layouts work when:**\n- There's ONE thing that matters most (clear hero)\n- You want to create visual flow/movement\n- The data has natural hierarchy\n\n**Either way, add visual interest:**\n- If symmetric: vary element sizes, use different treatments for hero\n- If asymmetric: make the hierarchy obvious through sizing\n\n### What Makes a Layout Feel Generic\n\nAvoid these patterns that scream \"AI-generated template\":\n\n- **Everything the same size** - All KPIs identical, all cards identical\n- **No clear hero** - Nothing stands out as most important\n- **Uniform spacing everywhere** - No visual grouping\n- **Only cards** - No inline elements, no variation in container styles\n- **No breathing room** - Elements crammed together without whitespace\n\n### Mobile Layout (Phone)\n\nDesign mobile as a **completely separate experience**, not a squeezed desktop.\n\n**Mobile Principles:**\n- **Vertical flow** - One column, top to bottom\n- **Thumb-friendly** - Important actions in bottom half\n- **Focused** - Show less, but show it well\n- **Progressive** - Reveal details on interaction\n- **Hero stands out** - Make the most important element visually dominant\n\n**Mobile Questions:**\n- What needs to be LARGER for comfortable touch?\n- Where should the primary action live? (Thumb zone)\n- How does the hero stand out from other content?\n- How should content be reorganized to fit the vertical flow?\n\nNote: Only hide elements on mobile if they're truly impossible to use on a phone. Users expect the same functionality on all devices.\n\n**Mobile Layout Ideas:**\n- Hero KPI takes entire top fold, everything else scrolls below\n- Compact horizontal scroll for secondary KPIs\n- Inline summary row (not cards) for quick stats\n- Bottom sheet for additional details\n\n### Desktop Layout\n\nDesign desktop to take full advantage of horizontal space.\n\n**Desktop Principles:**\n- **Use the width** - Multi-column layouts where appropriate\n- **Horizontal density** - Side-by-side information\n- **Hover reveals** - Secondary info on hover\n- **Peripheral vision** - Context without overwhelming\n- **Keyboard awareness** - Power user shortcuts\n\n**Desktop Questions:**\n- How does the extra width add value? (Not just stretching)\n- Which side gets the hero element?\n- What information benefits from side-by-side comparison?\n- What hover states add useful information?\n- Where can you break the grid intentionally?\n\n**Desktop Layout Ideas:**\n- Wide left column (hero + chart) + narrow right column (recent activity)\n- Full-width hero banner, then 3 unequal columns below\n- Sidebar with key stats, main area with detailed views\n- Sticky summary header while scrolling through details\n\n---\n\n## Information Hierarchy\n\nUsers scan, they don't read. Design for scanning.\n\n**Hierarchy Levels:**\n1. **Primary** - ONE thing that matters most (largest, boldest)\n2. **Secondary** - Supporting information (medium)\n3. **Tertiary** - Details, metadata (smallest, muted)\n\n**Hierarchy Tools:**\n- Size (larger = more important)\n- Weight (bolder = more important)\n- Color (accent = important/interactive)\n- Position (top/left = seen first)\n- Space (more whitespace = more important)\n\n---\n\n## Your Output: design_brief.md\n\nWrite a detailed design brief in Markdown.

What proportions?\n- Where does the eye go first, second, third?\n- What creates visual interest in this layout?]\n\n### Section Layout\n[Describe what goes where:\n- Top area: [what content]\n- Main content area: [what content]\n- Supporting areas: [what content]\nInclude proportions if using multi-column layout.]\n\n### What Appears on Hover\n[What extra information is revealed when hovering over elements?]\n\n### Clickable/Interactive Areas (if applicable)\n[If any elements should open detail views when clicked, note them here.\nOnly add where it provides additional useful information.]\n\n---\n\n## 6. Components\n\n### Hero KPI\nThe MOST important metric that users see first.\n\n- **Title:** [Name]\n- **Data source:** [Which app to query]\n- **Calculation:** [How to calculate: sum, count, latest, etc.]\n- **Display:** [How it looks - large number? With icon? Progress ring?]\n- **Context shown:** [What comparison? Goal progress? Trend?]\n- **Why this is the hero:** [Explain why this matters most to users]\n\n### Secondary KPIs\n[For each secondary KPI:]\n\n**[KPI Name]**\n- Source: [App]\n- Calculation: [How]\n- Format: [number/currency/percent]\n- Display: [Card? Inline? Size?]\n\n### Chart (if applicable)\n- **Type:** [line/bar/area - and WHY this type]\n- **Title:** [Chart title]\n- **What question it answers:** [Why does the user need this chart?]\n- **Data source:** [App]\n- **X-axis:** [Field, label]\n- **Y-axis:** [Field, label]\n- **Mobile simplification:** [How is it simplified for small screens?]\n\n### Lists/Tables (if applicable)\n[For each list:]\n\n**[Section Name]**\n- Purpose: [Why users need this]\n- Source: [App]\n- Fields shown: [Which fields]\n- Mobile style: [cards/simple list]\n- Desktop style: [table/cards]\n- Sort: [By what field]\n- Limit: [How many items]\n\n### Primary Action Button (REQUIRED!)\n\n**⚠️ Every dashboard MUST have a primary action.** This is NOT a read-only view!\n\nUsers need to DO things from the dashboard, not just look at data. The most common action should be one tap/click away.\n\nThink about what action users perform most often:\n- Adding a new record (workout, meal, expense, etc.)\n- Logging something (weight, progress, status)\n- Starting a process (timer, session, etc.)\n\n**This section is REQUIRED - do not skip it or write \"None\"!**\n\n- **Label:** [Action-oriented text, e.g. \"Workout starten\", \"Mahlzeit hinzufügen\"]\n- **Action:** [add_record | navigate - specify which]\n- **Target app:** [Which Living Apps app receives the data]\n- **What data:** [What fields will the form contain]\n- **Mobile position:** [bottom_fixed (recommended) | header | fab]\n- **Desktop position:** [header | sidebar | inline]\n- **Why this action:** [Why is this the most important thing users do?]\n\nThe implementation skill knows how to create forms that send data to Living Apps API.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Visual Details\n\n### Border Radius\n[sharp (4px) / rounded (8px) / pill (16px+)]\n\n### Shadows\n[none / subtle / elevated - describe the shadow style]\n\n### Spacing\n[compact / normal / spacious - how much breathing room?]\n\n### Animations\n- **Page load:** [none / fade / stagger]\n- **Hover effects:** [What happens on hover?]\n- **Tap feedback:** [What happens on tap?]\n\n---\n\n## 8. CSS Variables (Copy Exactly!)\n\nThe implementer MUST copy these values exactly into `src/index.css`:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --background: hsl(...);\n  --foreground: hsl(...);\n  --card: hsl(...);\n  --card-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --popover: hsl(...);\n  --popover-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --primary: hsl(...);\n  --primary-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --secondary: hsl(...);\n  --secondary-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --muted: hsl(...);\n  --muted-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --accent: hsl(...);\n  --accent-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --destructive: hsl(...);\n  --border: hsl(...);\n  --input: hsl(...);\n  --ring: hsl(...);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9. Implementation Checklist\n\nThe implementer should verify:\n- [ ] Font loaded from URL above\n- [ ] All CSS variables copied exactly\n- [ ] Mobile layout matches Section 4\n- [ ] Desktop layout matches Section 5\n- [ ] Hero element is prominent as described\n- [ ] Colors create the mood described in Section 2\n```\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ How Colors Are Applied (Critical!)\n\nYour colors are mapped to CSS variables. The implementation agent uses them directly.\n\n**Color Mapping:**\n\n| Your design_brief color | CSS Variable |\n|-------------------------|--------------|\n| `background` | `--background` |\n| `foreground` | `--foreground` |\n| `card` | `--card` |\n| `card_foreground` | `--card-foreground` |\n| `primary` | `--primary` |\n| `primary_foreground` | `--primary-foreground` |\n| `accent` | `--accent` |\n| `muted` | `--muted` |\n| `muted_foreground` | `--muted-foreground` |\n| `border` | `--border` |\n| `negative` | `--destructive` |\n\n**Light Theme Contrast Rules:**\n- `foreground` must be dark (readable on light backgrounds)\n- `card` can be white or slightly off-white\n- `card_foreground` must be dark\n- `primary` needs sufficient contrast for buttons\n\n**All colors MUST be complete hsl() functions:**\n```\n\"background\": \"hsl(40 20% 98%)\"   // ✅ Complete function\n\"background\": \"40 20% 98%\"        // ❌ Will break!\n```\n\n---\n\n## Quality Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing design_brief.md:\n\n### Distinctiveness\n- [ ] Would a designer recognize this as intentionally designed (not default)?\n- [ ] Is there at least ONE memorable visual detail?\n- [ ] Is the font choice appropriate and NOT from forbidden list?\n- [ ] Does the color accent feel considered, not generic?\n\n### Layout & UX (CRITICAL FOR AVOIDING AI SLOP!)\n- [ ] Is there ONE clear hero element that stands out?\n- [ ] Is there visual interest? (size variation, typography hierarchy, spacing variation)\n- [ ] NOT everything the same size - some variation exists\n- [ ] Is mobile designed FOR mobile (not just smaller)?\n- [ ] Does desktop use horizontal space meaningfully?\n- [ ] Would this get featured in the App Store?\n\n### Interactivity\n- [ ] Is the primary action clearly defined?\n- [ ] Are clickable elements marked where drill-down adds value?\n\n### Information\n- [ ] Is the visual hierarchy clear?\n- [ ] Are all relevant KPIs included?\n\n### Clarity\n- [ ] Is every section detailed enough that someone else could implement it?\n- [ ] Are there WHY explanations for major decisions?\n- [ ] Are the CSS variables complete and ready to copy?\n- [ ] Is the Layout Strategy section filled out with specific proportions?\n\n### Technical\n- [ ] Are all colors complete hsl() functions?\n- [ ] Is contrast sufficient for readability?\n- [ ] Are all required colors defined?\n\n---\n\n## Remember\n\n1. **Write for the implementer** - They will follow your words exactly\n2. **Explain WHY** - Context helps them understand intent\n3. **Be specific** - \"Large number\" is vague, \"48px bold\" is specific\n4. **Minimal ≠ Generic** - Minimal can be distinctive\n5. **Layout is everything** - 80% of design time on layout\n6. **Visual interest is required** - Vary sizes, not everything identical\n7. **Mobile ≠ Small Desktop** - Separate experiences\n8. **One memorable detail** - What makes this special?\n9. **App Store quality** - Would Apple feature this?\n","numLines":613,"startLine":1,"totalLines":613}}}

App Analysis\n\n### What This App Does\nThe Ausgabentracker is an expense tracking application that allows users to record, categorize, and monitor their spending. It consists of three interconnected apps: \"Kategorien\" for expense categories, \"Ausgaben\" for the actual expense records with amounts, dates, descriptions, and optional receipts, and \"Ausgabe erfassen\" for the data entry form.\n\n### Who Uses This\nGerman-speaking individuals who want to keep track of their personal or small business expenses. They're practical people who want a quick overview of where their money goes without the complexity of full accounting software.\n\n### The ONE Thing Users Care About Most\n**\"Wie viel habe ich diesen Monat ausgegeben?\"** (How much have I spent this month?)\n\nUsers open this app to quickly see their current monthly spending total and understand their spending patterns by category.\n\n### Primary Actions (IMPORTANT!)\n1. **Ausgabe hinzufügen** → Primary Action Button (Add new expense - the most common action)\n2. View expenses by category\n3. Browse recent expenses\n\n---\n\n## 2. What Makes This Design Distinctive\n\n### Visual Identity\nThis design uses a sophisticated forest green accent against a warm off-white background, creating a grounded, trustworthy feel appropriate for financial tracking. The green evokes stability and growth—psychological associations that help users feel positive about tracking their finances rather than anxious. The warm paper-like background gives the dashboard a tangible, almost notebook-like quality.\n\n### Layout Strategy\n- **Asymmetric layout on desktop** with the hero spending total prominently positioned in a wide left column, creating immediate visual impact\n- **Hero emphasis through size**: The monthly total is displayed at 56px on desktop, dwarfing secondary KPIs at 24px—a 2.3x size ratio that creates unmistakable hierarchy\n- **Whitespace as luxury**: Generous padding around the hero section (48px on desktop) signals importance\n- **Secondary elements in compact format**: Category breakdown uses horizontal bars, not cards, to avoid competing with the hero\n- **Size variation**: Mix of full-width hero, medium cards for chart, and compact list for recent expenses\n\n### Unique Element\nThe category breakdown uses a distinctive horizontal bar visualization where each category shows both the amount and a proportional bar colored with a muted tint of the primary green. The bars have slightly rounded ends and a subtle inner shadow, giving them a tactile, almost physical quality like paper tabs in a ledger.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Theme & Colors\n\n### Font\n- **Family:** Plus Jakarta Sans\n- **URL:** `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Plus+Jakarta+Sans:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap`\n- **Why this font:** Plus Jakarta Sans has a professional, slightly geometric character that feels modern and trustworthy—perfect for a financial app. Its rounded terminals soften the numbers without losing clarity.\n\n### Color Palette\nAll colors as complete hsl() functions:\n\n| Purpose | Color | CSS Variable |\n|---------|-------|--------------|\n| Page background | `hsl(45 30% 97%)` | `--background` |\n| Main text | `hsl(150 20% 15%)` | `--foreground` |\n| Card background | `hsl(0 0% 100%)` | `--card` |\n| Card text | `hsl(150 20% 15%)` | `--card-foreground` |\n| Borders | `hsl(45 15% 88%)` | `--border` |\n| Primary action | `hsl(158 45% 32%)` | `--primary` |\n| Text on primary | `hsl(0 0% 100%)` | `--primary-foreground` |\n| Accent highlight | `hsl(158 35% 92%)` | `--accent` |\n| Muted background | `hsl(45 20% 94%)` | `--muted` |\n| Muted text | `hsl(150 10% 45%)` | `--muted-foreground` |\n| Success/positive | `hsl(158 50% 40%)` | (component use) |\n| Error/negative | `hsl(0 65% 50%)` | `--destructive` |\n\n### Why These Colors\nThe forest green primary creates a sense of financial stability and growth. The warm cream background (slight yellow undertone) feels welcoming and less clinical than pure white. This combination evokes the feeling of a well-organized leather notebook—professional yet personal.\n\n### Background Treatment\nThe page background uses a warm off-white (`hsl(45 30% 97%)`) with a subtle cream undertone. Cards are pure white, creating a gentle lift from the background without harsh shadows. This layering creates depth while maintaining the light, airy feel.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mobile Layout (Phone)\n\nDesign mobile as a COMPLETELY SEPARATE experience, not squeezed desktop.\n\n### Layout Approach\nThe hero dominates the first viewport, taking approximately 35% of screen height. Visual interest is created through extreme typography contrast (hero at 44px, secondary at 14px) and the horizontal category bars below that create a rhythmic pattern.\n\n### What Users See (Top to Bottom)\n\n**Header:**\n- Simple, clean header with app title \"Ausgabentracker\" in 18px semibold\n- No navigation clutter—this is a single-page dashboard\n\n**Hero Section (The FIRST thing users see):**\n- **What:** Monthly spending total displayed as currency\n- **Size:** 44px font weight 700, centered, takes ~35% of first viewport\n- **Label:** \"Diesen Monat\" (This month) in 14px muted text above the number\n- **Styling:** The number itself is in the dark foreground color with a subtle text shadow for depth\n- **Supporting:** Current month name displayed below in muted text (e.g., \"Januar 2026\")\n- **Why hero:** This directly answers the user's primary question: \"How much have I spent?\"\n\n**Section 2: Kategorien-Übersicht (Category Overview)**\n- Horizontal scroll container with category pills\n- Each pill shows: category name + amount spent (e.g., \"Lebensmittel €234\")\n- Pills have the muted green background with dark text\n- Compact design: 12px text, 8px padding\n- Why here: Users want to quickly see WHERE money went\n\n**Section 3: Spending Trend Chart**\n- Simple area chart showing last 7 days of spending\n- Minimal axis labels, clean green fill\n- Height: 160px\n- Shows daily spending pattern at a glance\n- Light grid lines, no heavy borders\n\n**Section 4: Letzte Ausgaben (Recent Expenses)**\n- Simple list, last 5 expenses\n- Each row: Description (left), Amount (right), Date below description in muted\n- Minimal dividers (1px border-bottom)\n- Tap to expand and show category/notes if available\n\n**Bottom Navigation / Action:**\n- Fixed bottom button: \"Ausgabe hinzufügen\" (Add Expense)\n- Full width minus 16px padding on each side\n- 56px height for comfortable thumb tap\n- Primary green background, white text, rounded-lg\n\n### Mobile-Specific Adaptations\n- Category overview becomes horizontal scroll instead of vertical bars\n- Chart simplified to area chart without detailed labels\n- Recent expenses as compact list instead of cards\n- All content accessible through scrolling, nothing hidden\n\n### Touch Targets\n- Bottom action button: 56px height (exceeds 44px minimum)\n- Category pills: 44px touch target height\n- List items: 56px minimum height per row\n\n### Interactive Elements\n- Tapping a recent expense row reveals full details (category, notes, receipt link)\n- Category pills can be tapped to filter (future enhancement, visually indicated with subtle feedback)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Desktop Layout\n\n### Overall Structure\nAsymmetric two-column layout:\n- **Left column (65%):** Hero spending total + spending chart\n- **Right column (35%):** Category breakdown + recent expenses\n- Maximum content width: 1200px, centered with auto margins\n- Gap between columns: 32px\n\nEye flow: Hero total (top-left) → Chart (below hero) → Categories (top-right) → Recent (bottom-right)\n\n### Section Layout\n\n**Top Area (Left Column - Hero):**\n- Monthly total at 56px, positioned with 48px top padding\n- \"Diesen Monat\" label above in 14px uppercase tracking-wide muted\n- Month name below in 16px muted\n- Entire hero section has 48px bottom padding before chart\n\n**Main Content (Left Column - Chart):**\n- Card containing area chart\n- Title: \"Ausgaben der letzten 30 Tage\"\n- Chart height: 280px\n- Shows spending over time with smooth area fill\n- Hover shows exact amount for each day\n\n**Right Column - Top (Categories):**\n- Card with title \"Nach Kategorie\"\n- Horizontal bar chart style list\n- Each category: name on left, amount on right, proportional bar behind\n- Bars use primary color at 15% opacity\n- Sorted by amount descending\n- Shows all categories\n\n**Right Column - Bottom (Recent):**\n- Card with title \"Letzte Ausgaben\"\n- Table-style list, last 10 expenses\n- Columns: Datum | Beschreibung | Kategorie | Betrag\n- Subtle row hover effect\n- Amounts right-aligned, formatted as currency\n\n### What Appears on Hover\n- Chart: Tooltip with exact date and amount\n- Category bars: Full amount with percentage of total\n- Recent expense rows: Subtle background highlight, shows notes if available\n\n### Clickable/Interactive Areas\n- Category bars: Click to filter recent expenses by category (visual feedback on click)\n- Recent expense rows: Click to view full details in a slide-over panel\n\n---\n\n## 6. Components\n\n### Hero KPI\nThe MOST important metric that users see first.\n\n- **Title:** Gesamtausgaben diesen Monat\n- **Data source:** Ausgaben app, filtered by current month\n- **Calculation:** Sum of all `betrag` fields where `datum` is in current month\n- **Display:** Large currency format (e.g., \"€ 1.234,56\") with German locale formatting\n- **Context shown:** Current month name displayed below (e.g., \"Januar 2026\")\n- **Why this is the hero:** Directly answers \"How much have I spent this month?\"—the #1 user question\n\n### Secondary KPIs\n**Ausgaben heute (Today's Spending)**\n- Source: Ausgaben app\n- Calculation: Sum of betrag where datum = today\n- Format: Currency (€)\n- Display: Inline text in hero section, smaller (20px), muted\n\n**Anzahl Transaktionen (Transaction Count)**\n- Source: Ausgaben app\n- Calculation: Count of records this month\n- Format: Number\n- Display: Small badge next to month name (e.g., \"23 Ausgaben\")\n\n### Chart\n- **Type:** Area chart (smooth line with filled area below) - WHY: Shows spending flow over time, softer than bars for daily data\n- **Title:** Ausgaben der letzten 30 Tage\n- **What question it answers:** \"What's my spending pattern?\" - helps users see if they're spending steadily or in bursts\n- **Data source:** Ausgaben app\n- **X-axis:** datum (Date), displayed as \"DD.MM\" format\n- **Y-axis:** betrag (Amount), displayed as \"€X\"\n- **Mobile simplification:** Show last 7 days only, simplified axis labels\n\n### Lists/Tables\n\n**Kategorien-Übersicht**\n- Purpose: Shows spending breakdown by category\n- Source: Ausgaben app joined with Kategorien\n- Fields shown: kategoriename, sum of betrag per category\n- Mobile style: Horizontal scroll pills\n- Desktop style: Horizontal bar chart list in card\n- Sort: By total amount descending\n- Limit: All categories\n\n**Letzte Ausgaben**\n- Purpose: Quick access to recent transactions\n- Source: Ausgaben app\n- Fields shown: datum, beschreibung, kategorie (resolved name), betrag\n- Mobile style: Simple compact list\n- Desktop style: Table with subtle styling\n- Sort: By datum descending\n- Limit: 5 on mobile, 10 on desktop\n\n### Primary Action Button (REQUIRED!)\n\n- **Label:** \"Ausgabe hinzufügen\"\n- **Action:** add_record\n- **Target app:** Ausgaben (696f8228ac959abad478a05a)\n- **What data:** Form with fields:\n  - betrag (number input, required) - \"Betrag (€)\"\n  - beschreibung (text input, required) - \"Beschreibung\"\n  - kategorie (select from Kategorien) - \"Kategorie\"\n  - datum (date picker, default today) - \"Datum\"\n  - notizen (textarea, optional) - \"Notizen\"\n- **Mobile position:** bottom_fixed (floating at bottom, always visible)\n- **Desktop position:** header (top right of dashboard, next to title)\n- **Why this action:** Adding expenses is the core interaction—users open the app specifically to log spending. One-tap access is essential.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Visual Details\n\n### Border Radius\nRounded (8px) - `--radius: 0.5rem` - Soft but not playful, appropriate for financial app\n\n### Shadows\nSubtle - Cards have `shadow-sm` (0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)). No heavy shadows. Elevation comes from background color contrast.\n\n### Spacing\nNormal - 16px base unit. Cards have 24px internal padding. Sections separated by 24px. Hero has extra breathing room (48px vertical padding).\n\n### Animations\n- **Page load:** Subtle fade-in (200ms) for content sections, staggered\n- **Hover effects:** Cards lift slightly (translateY -2px), category bars brighten\n- **Tap feedback:** Scale down to 0.98 on tap, spring back\n\n---\n\n## 8. CSS Variables (Copy Exactly!)\n\nThe implementer MUST copy these values exactly into `src/index.css`:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --radius: 0.5rem;\n  --background: hsl(45 30% 97%);\n  --foreground: hsl(150 20% 15%);\n  --card: hsl(0 0% 100%);\n  --card-foreground: hsl(150 20% 15%);\n  --popover: hsl(0 0% 100%);\n  --popover-foreground: hsl(150 20% 15%);\n  --primary: hsl(158 45% 32%);\n  --primary-foreground: hsl(0 0% 100%);\n  --secondary: hsl(45 20% 94%);\n  --secondary-foreground: hsl(150 20% 20%);\n  --muted: hsl(45 20% 94%);\n  --muted-foreground: hsl(150 10% 45%);\n  --accent: hsl(158 35% 92%);\n  --accent-foreground: hsl(150 20% 15%);\n  --destructive: hsl(0 65% 50%);\n  --border: hsl(45 15% 88%);\n  --input: hsl(45 15% 88%);\n  --ring: hsl(158 45% 32%);\n  --chart-1: hsl(158 45% 32%);\n  --chart-2: hsl(158 35% 45%);\n  --chart-3: hsl(158 25% 55%);\n  --chart-4: hsl(158 20% 65%);\n  --chart-5: hsl(158 15% 75%);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9.

App Analysis\n\n### What This App Does\nThe Ausgabentracker is an expense tracking application that allows users to record, categorize, and monitor their spending. It consists of three interconnected apps: \"Kategorien\" for expense categories, \"Ausgaben\" for the actual expense records with amounts, dates, descriptions, and optional receipts, and \"Ausgabe erfassen\" for the data entry form.\n\n### Who Uses This\nGerman-speaking individuals who want to keep track of their personal or small business expenses. They're practical people who want a quick overview of where their money goes without the complexity of full accounting software.\n\n### The ONE Thing Users Care About Most\n**\"Wie viel habe ich diesen Monat ausgegeben?\"** (How much have I spent this month?)\n\nUsers open this app to quickly see their current monthly spending total and understand their spending patterns by category.\n\n### Primary Actions (IMPORTANT!)\n1. **Ausgabe hinzufügen** → Primary Action Button (Add new expense - the most common action)\n2. View expenses by category\n3. Browse recent expenses\n\n---\n\n## 2. What Makes This Design Distinctive\n\n### Visual Identity\nThis design uses a sophisticated forest green accent against a warm off-white background, creating a grounded, trustworthy feel appropriate for financial tracking. The green evokes stability and growth—psychological associations that help users feel positive about tracking their finances rather than anxious. The warm paper-like background gives the dashboard a tangible, almost notebook-like quality.\n\n### Layout Strategy\n- **Asymmetric layout on desktop** with the hero spending total prominently positioned in a wide left column, creating immediate visual impact\n- **Hero emphasis through size**: The monthly total is displayed at 56px on desktop, dwarfing secondary KPIs at 24px—a 2.3x size ratio that creates unmistakable hierarchy\n- **Whitespace as luxury**: Generous padding around the hero section (48px on desktop) signals importance\n- **Secondary elements in compact format**: Category breakdown uses horizontal bars, not cards, to avoid competing with the hero\n- **Size variation**: Mix of full-width hero, medium cards for chart, and compact list for recent expenses\n\n### Unique Element\nThe category breakdown uses a distinctive horizontal bar visualization where each category shows both the amount and a proportional bar colored with a muted tint of the primary green. The bars have slightly rounded ends and a subtle inner shadow, giving them a tactile, almost physical quality like paper tabs in a ledger.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Theme & Colors\n\n### Font\n- **Family:** Plus Jakarta Sans\n- **URL:** `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Plus+Jakarta+Sans:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap`\n- **Why this font:** Plus Jakarta Sans has a professional, slightly geometric character that feels modern and trustworthy—perfect for a financial app. Its rounded terminals soften the numbers without losing clarity.\n\n### Color Palette\nAll colors as complete hsl() functions:\n\n| Purpose | Color | CSS Variable |\n|---------|-------|--------------|\n| Page background | `hsl(45 30% 97%)` | `--background` |\n| Main text | `hsl(150 20% 15%)` | `--foreground` |\n| Card background | `hsl(0 0% 100%)` | `--card` |\n| Card text | `hsl(150 20% 15%)` | `--card-foreground` |\n| Borders | `hsl(45 15% 88%)` | `--border` |\n| Primary action | `hsl(158 45% 32%)` | `--primary` |\n| Text on primary | `hsl(0 0% 100%)` | `--primary-foreground` |\n| Accent highlight | `hsl(158 35% 92%)` | `--accent` |\n| Muted background | `hsl(45 20% 94%)` | `--muted` |\n| Muted text | `hsl(150 10% 45%)` | `--muted-foreground` |\n| Success/positive | `hsl(158 50% 40%)` | (component use) |\n| Error/negative | `hsl(0 65% 50%)` | `--destructive` |\n\n### Why These Colors\nThe forest green primary creates a sense of financial stability and growth. The warm cream background (slight yellow undertone) feels welcoming and less clinical than pure white. This combination evokes the feeling of a well-organized leather notebook—professional yet personal.\n\n### Background Treatment\nThe page background uses a warm off-white (`hsl(45 30% 97%)`) with a subtle cream undertone. Cards are pure white, creating a gentle lift from the background without harsh shadows. This layering creates depth while maintaining the light, airy feel.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mobile Layout (Phone)\n\nDesign mobile as a COMPLETELY SEPARATE experience, not squeezed desktop.\n\n### Layout Approach\nThe hero dominates the first viewport, taking approximately 35% of screen height.

Your ONLY job is to **implement exactly what design_brief.md describes**.\n\n## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Build a COMPLETE, PRODUCTION-READY Dashboard\n\n**This is not a prototype. This is not a demo. This is a production dashboard.**\n\nYou MUST:\n- **Implement EVERY feature** described in design_brief.md - do not skip anything\n- **Show ALL information** users need - no placeholder \"coming soon\" sections\n- **Primary action must work** - users can add/create from the dashboard\n- **Handle all states** - loading, empty, error states for every component\n- **Be ready for real users** - this goes live immediately after you build it\n\n**DO NOT:**\n- ❌ Skip features because they seem complex\n- ❌ Leave any section incomplete with \"TODO\" comments\n- ❌ Implement only the \"happy path\"\n- ❌ Create a read-only view when actions are needed\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ CRITICAL: You Do NOT Make Design Decisions\n\nAll design decisions are ALREADY MADE in `design_brief.md`. The designer wrote detailed instructions - follow them word for word.\n\n**Your job:**\n1. Read design_brief.md COMPLETELY\n2. Implement EXACTLY what it describes\n3. Do not deviate or \"improve\"\n\n**FORBIDDEN Actions:**\n- ❌ Choosing a different font than the brief specifies\n- ❌ Changing colors from the brief\n- ❌ Rearranging the layout differently than described\n- ❌ Adding components not mentioned in the brief\n- ❌ Using \"sensible defaults\" instead of what the brief says\n- ❌ Using Inter, Roboto, or system fonts (unless brief says so)\n- ❌ Interpreting the brief \"creatively\" - implement literally\n\n**The design_brief.md is written instructions from a designer. Follow them exactly.**\n\n---\n\n## Process\n\n### Step 1: Read the Design Brief COMPLETELY\n\n```bash\ncat design_brief.md\n```\n\nRead the ENTIRE brief carefully. Pay attention to:\n\n- **Section 3: Theme & Colors** → Font name, URL, and all color values\n- **Section 4: Mobile Layout** → Exact structure for phone screens\n- **Section 5: Desktop Layout** → Exact structure for computer screens\n- **Section 6: Components** → Hero KPI, secondary KPIs, charts, lists\n- **Section 7: Visual Details** → Border radius, shadows, animations\n- **Section 8: CSS Variables** → Copy these EXACTLY into src/index.css\n\nThe brief explains WHY decisions were made. This helps you understand intent, but your job is to implement what is written, not to interpret.\n\n### Step 2: Read Existing Code\n\n```bash\ncat src/types/*.ts\ncat src/services/livingAppsService.ts\n```\n\n### Step 3: Apply CSS Variables FIRST (CRITICAL!)\n\nBefore writing any React code, update the theme. Copy the CSS from **Section 8** of design_brief.md into `src/index.css`.\n\nshadcn/ui components use Tailwind CSS variables. If you don't update them, `<Card>`, `<Button>`, etc. will use **default colors** that don't match the design!\n\n```\ndesign_brief.md → src/index.css → Tailwind classes → shadcn components\n   (Section 8)      (CSS variables)   (bg-card, etc.)   (Card, Button)\n```\n\n#### Step 3a: Copy CSS Variables\n\nThe design_brief.md Section 8 contains ready-to-copy CSS. Copy it EXACTLY:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Copy ALL values from design_brief.md Section 8 */\n  --background: hsl(...);\n  --foreground: hsl(...);\n  /* etc. */\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 3b: Light Mode (Always)\n\nThe design brief uses light mode. Make sure `index.html` does NOT have `class=\"dark\"`:\n\n```html\n<html lang=\"de\">  <!-- No \"dark\" class for light theme -->\n```\n\n### Step 4: Add Font\n\nCopy the font URL from **Section 3** of design_brief.md into `index.html`:\n\n```html\n<link href=\"[URL from Section 3]\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n```\n\n### Step 5: Implement Dashboard.tsx\n\nNow implement the React component following the brief:\n\n```typescript\n// 1. Imports (always use 'import type' for types!)\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport type { AppType1, AppType2 } from '@/types/app';\nimport { LivingAppsService } from '@/services/livingAppsService';\n\n// 2. Follow Section 4 (Mobile) and Section 5 (Desktop) for layout\n// 3. Follow Section 6 for components (Hero, KPIs, Charts, Lists)\n// 4. Follow Section 7 for visual details (radius, shadows, animations)\n```\n\n### Step 6: Build and Deploy\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThen call `mcp__deploy_tools__deploy_to_github`\n\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Light mode defaults - used when NO .dark class */\n}\n\n.dark {\n  /* Dark mode - used when <html class=\"dark\"> */\n}\n```\n\n**Color Mapping Table:**\n\n| design_brief.md section | CSS Variable | Used by |\n|----------------------|--------------|---------|\n| `theme.colors.background` | `--background` | `bg-background`, body |\n| `theme.colors.foreground` | `--foreground` | `text-foreground`, body text |\n| `theme.colors.card` | `--card` | `<Card>` background |\n| `theme.colors.foreground` | `--card-foreground` | Text inside cards |\n| `theme.colors.primary` | `--primary` | `<Button>` default |\n| `theme.colors.accent` | `--accent` | Accent elements |\n| `theme.colors.muted` | `--muted` | Muted backgrounds |\n| `theme.colors.border` | `--border` | All borders |\n| `theme.colors.positive` | `--chart-2` | Success/positive in charts |\n| `theme.colors.negative` | `--destructive` | Error/negative |\n\n#### Step 4c: Example - Applying a Dark Theme\n\nIf design_brief.md says:\n```json\n{\n  \"theme\": {\n    \"mode\": \"dark\",\n    \"colors\": {\n      \"background\": \"hsl(215 28% 7%)\",\n      \"foreground\": \"hsl(215 10% 92%)\",\n      \"card\": \"hsl(215 25% 12%)\",\n      \"primary\": \"hsl(25 95% 53%)\",\n      \"accent\": \"hsl(173 80% 45%)\",\n      \"muted\": \"hsl(215 15% 20%)\",\n      \"border\": \"hsl(215 20% 18%)\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen update `src/index.css`:\n\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: hsl(215 28% 7%);\n  --foreground: hsl(215 10% 92%);\n  \n  --card: hsl(215 25% 12%);\n  --card-foreground: hsl(215 10% 92%);\n  \n  --popover: hsl(215 25% 12%);\n  --popover-foreground: hsl(215 10% 92%);\n  \n  --primary: hsl(25 95% 53%);\n  --primary-foreground: hsl(215 28% 7%);\n  \n  --accent: hsl(173 80% 45%);\n  --accent-foreground: hsl(215 28% 7%);\n  \n  --muted: hsl(215 15% 20%);\n  --muted-foreground: hsl(215 10% 70%);\n  \n  --border: hsl(215 20% 18%);\n  --input: hsl(215 20% 18%);\n  --ring: hsl(173 80% 45%);\n}\n```\n\nAnd update `index.html`:\n```html\n<html lang=\"de\" class=\"dark\">\n```\n\n#### ⚠️ CRITICAL: CSS Color Format\n\nThe CSS variables **MUST use complete color functions**, not raw values!\n\n**❌ WRONG - Raw values break Tailwind:**\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: 220 25% 6%;        /* ❌ Just numbers - NOT a valid CSS color! */\n  --card: 220 20% 10%;             /* ❌ Browser ignores this, uses fallback! */\n}\n```\n\n**✅ CORRECT - Complete color functions:**\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: hsl(220 25% 6%);   /* ✓ Complete hsl() function */\n  --card: hsl(220 20% 10%);        /* ✓ Tailwind can use this */\n}\n```\n\n**Why raw values fail:**\n- Tailwind reads `var(--background)` directly for `bg-background`\n- If `--background` is `220 25% 6%` (just numbers), it's NOT a valid CSS color\n- Browser ignores invalid colors → falls back to white/transparent\n- Result: Light backgrounds with dark text = invisible!\n\n**Always copy the FULL hsl() function from design_brief.md Section 8, including the function name!**\n\n#### Why This Matters\n\nWithout this step:\n- `<Card>` uses default background (light/white)\n- Text colors (from design_brief) are for dark backgrounds\n- Result: **Light text on light cards = invisible!**\n\nWith this step:\n- All shadcn components automatically use your theme colors\n- Consistent look across all UI elements\n- No need to add inline styles everywhere\n\n### Step 5: Add Font from Spec\n\nIn `index.html`, add the font URL from design_brief.md Section 3:\n```html\n<link href=\"{font_url from spec}\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n```\n\n### Step 6: Build and Test\n\n```bash\nnpm run build  # Must compile without errors\n```\n\n### Step 7: Deploy\n\n```\nCall mcp__deploy_tools__deploy_to_github\n```\n\n---\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### 1. Type Imports\n```typescript\n// ❌ WRONG\nimport { Workout } from '@/types/app';\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nimport type { Workout } from '@/types/app';\n```\n\n### 2. extractRecordId Always Has Null Check\n```typescript\nconst id = extractRecordId(record.fields.relation);\nif (!id) return;  // ✅ Always check!\n```\n\n### 3. Dates Without Seconds\n```typescript\n// For API: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM (no seconds!)\nconst dateForAPI = formData.date + 'T12:00';\n```\n\n### 4. Select Never Has Empty Value\n```typescript\n// ❌ WRONG\n<SelectItem value=\"\">None</SelectItem>\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\n<SelectItem value=\"none\">None</SelectItem>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n\nBefore completing, verify EACH item against design_brief.md:\n\n### Theme Verification (CRITICAL!)\n- [ ] Font in `index.html` is EXACTLY from design_brief.md Section 3 (NOT Inter or Roboto!)\n- [ ] Font-family in CSS matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 3\n- [ ] `index.html` has NO \"dark\" class (light theme)\n- [ ] ALL CSS variables in `src/index.css` copied EXACTLY from design_brief.md Section 8\n- [ ] Colors are complete hsl() functions (not raw values)\n\n### Layout Verification\n- [ ] Mobile layout matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 4\n- [ ] Desktop layout matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 5\n- [ ] Hero element stands out as described\n- [ ] Section order matches the brief\n\n### Components Verification\n- [ ] Hero KPI matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6 \"Hero KPI\"\n- [ ] Secondary KPIs match EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6\n- [ ] Chart matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6 \"Chart\"\n- [ ] Primary action matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6\n\n### Visual Details Verification\n- [ ] Border radius matches design_brief.md Section 7\n- [ ] Shadow style matches design_brief.md Section 7\n- [ ] Animations match design_brief.md Section 7\n\n### Technical\n- [ ] `npm run build` passes\n- [ ] No console errors\n\n### ⚠️ COMPLETENESS VERIFICATION (CRITICAL!)\n\n**You MUST verify the dashboard is 100% complete before finishing:**\n\n- [ ] **Every app in app_metadata.json is used** - no data sources ignored\n- [ ] **Primary action works** (create new record via dialog/form)\n- [ ] **Data displays correctly** (all KPIs calculated, lists populated)\n- [ ] **All states handled:**\n  - [ ] Loading states for every data fetch\n  - [ ] Empty states with helpful guidance\n  - [ ] Error states with retry options\n- [ ] **Nothing is placeholder:**\n  - [ ] No \"TODO\" comments in code\n  - [ ] No \"Coming soon\" messages\n  - [ ] No hardcoded demo data\n\n**If ANY item above is unchecked, the dashboard is NOT complete. Fix it before deploying.**\n\n---\n\n## Definition of Done\n\nThe dashboard is complete when:\n\n1. ✅ **User experience excellent**: Intuitive, clear, professional\n2. ✅ **Primary action button works** (with Dialog/Modal)\n3. ✅ All KPIs/Stats calculated correctly\n4. ✅ Loading state works (Skeleton, not empty page)\n5. ✅ Error handling implemented (friendly messages)\n6. ✅ Empty state implemented (helpful placeholders)\n7. ✅ Responsive design (Mobile + Desktop)\n8. ✅ No TypeScript errors (`npm run build`)\n9. ✅ No console errors in browser\n10. ✅ Business logic correct\n11. ✅ Living Apps API rules followed (dates, applookup, response)\n12. ✅ **All features complete** - nothing skipped or left as TODO\n\n---\n\n## Drill-Down: When and How to Use It\n\nDrill-down is useful when there's **more information to show** than fits in the summary view. Don't add it everywhere - only where it adds value.\n\n### When to Use Drill-Down\n\n| Good Use Cases | Skip Drill-Down When... |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| List item → show full record details | The summary already shows everything |\n| Summary count → show the items being counted | It's a simple, self-explanatory number |\n| Record reference → view the related record | There's no additional detail to show |\n\n### Make It Obvious\n\nIf something is clickable, make it visually clear:\n- Hover effect (shadow, background change)\n- Cursor pointer\n- Underline or chevron icon for \"see more\"\n\n### Implementation Pattern: Clickable List Item\n\n```typescript\n// Use when list items have more details to show\n<div\n  className=\"p-3 rounded-lg hover:bg-muted cursor-pointer transition-colors\"\n  onClick={() => setSelectedRecord(record)}\n>\n  <div className=\"font-medium\">{record.name}</div>\n  <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">{record.summary}</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Don't force drill-down everywhere.** A simple KPI that shows \"5 workouts this week\" doesn't need a click handler if there's nothing more to show.\n\n---\n\n## UX Details - Don't Forget!\n\n### Loading States\n```typescript\nif (loading) {\n  return <LoadingState />;  // Use Skeleton, not spinner\n}\n```\n\n### Empty States\n```typescript\nif (data.length === 0) {\n  return (\n    <EmptyState \n      title=\"No data yet\"\n      description=\"Get started by adding your first item\"\n      action={<Button>Add First Item</Button>}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Error States\n```typescript\nif (error) {\n  return (\n    <Alert variant=\"destructive\">\n      <AlertCircle className=\"h-4 w-4\" />\n      <AlertTitle>Error</AlertTitle>\n      <AlertDescription>\n        {error.message}\n        <Button variant=\"outline\" onClick={retry}>Try Again</Button>\n      </AlertDescription>\n    </Alert>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Success Feedback\n```typescript\n// Use toast for success messages\nimport { toast } from '@/components/ui/use-toast';\n\ntoast({\n  title: \"Success!\",\n  description: \"Item saved successfully.\",\n});\n```\n\n### Hover States\n```typescript\n// Cards should have hover feedback\n<Card className=\"hover:shadow-md transition-shadow cursor-pointer\">\n```\n\n---\n\n# Living Apps API Reference\n\n## ⚠️ Critical API Rules\n\nThese rules are **non-negotiable**. Breaking them causes runtime errors.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Date Formats\n\nLiving Apps has strict date format requirements:\n\n| Field Type | Format | Example |\n|------------|--------|---------|\n| `date/datetimeminute` | `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM` | `2025-11-06T12:00` |\n| `date/date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | `2025-11-06` |\n\n### ❌ WRONG\n```typescript\n// Seconds are NOT allowed for datetimeminute!\nconst date = '2025-11-06T12:00:00';  // ❌ Will fail\n```\n\n### ✅ CORRECT\n```typescript\n// For date/datetimeminute fields\nconst dateForAPI = formData.datum + 'T12:00';  // ✅ YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM\n\n// For date/date fields\nconst dateForAPI = formData.datum;  // ✅ YYYY-MM-DD\n\n// Display in <input type=\"date\">\nconst dateForInput = apiData.datum?.split('T')[0];  // Extract YYYY-MM-DD\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. applookup Fields\n\n`applookup/select` fields store **full URLs** to related records.\n\n### URL Format\n```\nhttps://my.living-apps.de/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\n```\n\n### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Always use extractRecordId()\n\n```typescript\n// ❌ NEVER do this manually\nconst parts = url.split('/');\nconst id = parts[parts.length - 1];  // ❌ Fragile!\n\n// ✅ ALWAYS use the helper function\nimport { extractRecordId } from '@/services/livingAppsService';\n\nconst recordId = extractRecordId(url);\nif (!recordId) return;  // ✅ Always null-check!\n```\n\n### extractRecordId() Implementation\n```typescript\nexport function extractRecordId(url: string | null | undefined): string | null {\n  if (!url) return null;\n  // Extracts last 24 hex characters (Living Apps Record IDs)\n  const match = url.match(/([a-f0-9]{24})$/i);\n  return match ? match[1] : null;\n}\n```\n\n### Creating applookup Values\n```typescript\nimport { createRecordUrl, APP_IDS } from '@/services/livingAppsService';\n\n// When creating/updating records with applookup fields\nconst data = {\n  kategorie: createRecordUrl(APP_IDS.KATEGORIEN, selectedKategorieId),\n};\n\n// createRecordUrl returns:\n// 'https://my.living-apps.de/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}'\n```\n\n### applookup Can Be Null!\n```typescript\n// ❌ WRONG - Will crash if field is null\nworkoutLogs.forEach((log) => {\n  const id = extractRecordId(log.fields.uebung);\n  data[id] = log;  // ❌ Crashes if id is null\n});\n\n// ✅ CORRECT - Defensive programming\nworkoutLogs.forEach((log) => {\n  const id = extractRecordId(log.fields.uebung);\n  if (!id) return;  // ✅ Skip if null\n  if (!data[id]) data[id] = [];\n  data[id].push(log);\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. API Response Format\n\nLiving Apps returns **objects**, not arrays!\n\n### Response Structure\n```typescript\n// API returns:\n{\n  \"690abc123...\": {\n    \"createdat\": \"2025-11-06T10:00:00\",\n    \"updatedat\": null,\n    \"fields\": {\n      \"name\": \"Item 1\",\n      \"value\": 100\n    }\n  },\n  \"690def456...\": {\n    \"createdat\": \"2025-11-06T11:00:00\",\n    \"updatedat\": null,\n    \"fields\": {\n      \"name\": \"Item 2\",\n      \"value\": 200\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### ❌ WRONG Transformation\n```typescript\n// Loses record_id!\nconst items = Object.values(response);  // ❌ No record_id!\n```\n\n### ✅ CORRECT Transformation\n```typescript\n// Use Object.entries() to preserve record_id\nconst items = Object.entries(response).map(([record_id, record]) => ({\n  record_id,  // ← From the key\n  createdat: record.createdat,\n  updatedat: record.updatedat,\n  ...record.fields,\n}));\n```\n\n### Why record_id Matters\n- Required for React `key` prop\n- Required for update/delete operations\n- Required for applookup references\n\n---\n\n## 4. API Authentication\n\n```typescript\nconst headers = {\n  'X-API-Key': API_KEY,  // From environment\n  'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  'Accept': 'application/json',\n};\n```\n\n### Proxy vs Direct URL\n```typescript\n// For API calls (via proxy)\nconst API_BASE = '/api/rest';\n\n// For applookup values (direct)\nconst APPLOOKUP_BASE = 'https://my.living-apps.de/rest';\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. CRUD Operations\n\n### GET All Records\n```typescript\nGET /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records\n```\n\n### GET Single Record\n```typescript\nGET /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\n```\n\n### CREATE Record\n```typescript\nPOST /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"New Item\",\n  \"value\": 100\n}\n```\n\n### UPDATE Record\n```typescript\nPATCH /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"value\": 150  // Only changed fields\n}\n```\n\n### DELETE Record\n```typescript\nDELETE /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\n\n// Note: DELETE also returns JSON, always call response.json()\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Error Handling\n\n```typescript\nasync function callAPI(method: string, endpoint: string, data?: any) {\n  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}${endpoint}`, {\n    method,\n    headers: {\n      'X-API-Key': API_KEY,\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n    },\n    body: data ? JSON.stringify(data) : undefined,\n  });\n\n  if (!response.ok) {\n    const errorText = await response.text();\n    throw new Error(`API Error (${response.status}): ${errorText}`);\n  }\n\n  return response.json();  // Always parse JSON, even for DELETE\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7. Metadata Structure\n\n`app_metadata.json` contains the **complete, real metadata from Living Apps REST API**.\n\n**IMPORTANT:**\n- `controls` is an **OBJECT** (not array!)\n- Each control has `identifier`, `label`, `type`, `subtype`, `fulltype`\n- `lookup/select` has `lookup_data` with all options\n- `applookup/select` has `lookup_app` URL to the linked app\n\n```typescript\n{\n  \"appgroup_id\": \"...\",\n  \"appgroup_name\": \"My App Group\",\n  \"apps\": {\n    \"app_identifier\": {\n      \"app_id\": \"...\",\n      \"name\": \"App Display Name\",\n      \"controls\": {\n        \"control_identifier\": {\n          \"identifier\": \"field_name\",      // Use this as field key\n          \"label\": \"Field Label\",          // Use this for UI display\n          \"type\": \"string\",                // Base type\n          \"subtype\": null,                 // or \"select\", \"textarea\", etc.\n          \"fulltype\": \"string/text\",       // Combined: type/subtype\n          \"lookup_data\": [                 // For lookup/select fields\n            { \"key\": \"option1\", \"value\": \"Option 1\" },\n            { \"key\": \"option2\", \"value\": \"Option 2\" }\n          ],\n          \"lookup_app\": \"https://my.living-apps.de/rest/apps/{app_id}\"  // For applookup\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Common Field Types\n| fulltype | TypeScript | Notes |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| `string/text` | `string` | Plain text |\n| `string/textarea` | `string` | Multiline text |\n| `number/number` | `number` | Numeric |\n| `bool/bool` | `boolean` | True/false |\n| `date/date` | `string` | YYYY-MM-DD |\n| `date/datetimeminute` | `string` | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM (NO seconds!) |\n| `lookup/select` | `string` | From predefined list (lookup_data) |\n| `applookup/select` | `string \\| null` | URL to another app's record |\n\n### Using Metadata for UI\n```typescript\n// Use field labels for UI\nconst fieldLabel = metadata.apps.myapp.controls.myfield.label;\n\n// Use lookup_data for Select options\nconst options = metadata.apps.myapp.controls.status.lookup_data;\n// → [{ key: \"active\", value: \"Active\" }, { key: \"done\", value: \"Done\" }]\n```\n\n---\n\n# Code Patterns Reference\n\n## Available Libraries\n\n### shadcn/ui Components\n\nAll shadcn components are pre-installed in `/src/components/ui/`\n\n```typescript\nimport { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from '@/components/ui/card';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport { Badge } from '@/components/ui/badge';\nimport { Input } from '@/components/ui/input';\nimport { Select, SelectContent, SelectItem, SelectTrigger, SelectValue } from '@/components/ui/select';\nimport { Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogTitle, DialogTrigger } from '@/components/ui/dialog';\nimport { Table, TableBody, TableCell, TableHead, TableHeader, TableRow } from '@/components/ui/table';\nimport { Skeleton } from '@/components/ui/skeleton';\nimport { Alert, AlertDescription, AlertTitle } from '@/components/ui/alert';\n// etc.\n```\n\n**To find specific components or examples, use shadcn MCP Tools:**\n```\nmcp_shadcn_search_items_in_registries(registries: ['@shadcn'], query: 'chart')\nmcp_shadcn_view_items_in_registries(items: ['@shadcn/card'])\nmcp_shadcn_get_item_examples_from_registries(registries: ['@shadcn'], query: 'card-demo')\n```\n\n### recharts (Charts)\n\nPre-installed!

createRecordUrl(APP_IDS.EXERCISES, formData.exerciseId)\n          : null,\n      };\n\n      await LivingAppsService.createWorkout(apiData);\n      onSuccess();\n    } catch (err) {\n      console.error('Failed to create:', err);\n    } finally {\n      setSubmitting(false);\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      {/* Form fields */}\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## shadcn/ui Component Patterns\n\n### Card with Stats\n\n```typescript\nimport { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from '@/components/ui/card';\n\nfunction StatCard({ title, value, icon: Icon }: StatProps) {\n  return (\n    <Card>\n      <CardHeader className=\"flex flex-row items-center justify-between pb-2\">\n        <CardTitle className=\"text-sm font-medium text-muted-foreground\">\n          {title}\n        </CardTitle>\n        {Icon && <Icon className=\"h-4 w-4 text-muted-foreground\" />}\n      </CardHeader>\n      <CardContent>\n        <div className=\"text-2xl font-bold\">{value}</div>\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### ⚠️ Select Component - No Empty Strings!\n\n```typescript\n// ❌ WRONG - Runtime error!\n<SelectItem value=\"\">No selection</SelectItem>\n\n// ✅ CORRECT - Use placeholder\n<Select value={value} onValueChange={setValue}>\n  <SelectTrigger>\n    <SelectValue placeholder=\"Select option...\" />\n  </SelectTrigger>\n  <SelectContent>\n    <SelectItem value=\"option1\">Option 1</SelectItem>\n    <SelectItem value=\"option2\">Option 2</SelectItem>\n  </SelectContent>\n</Select>\n\n// ✅ CORRECT - Use special value for \"none\"\n<Select value={value || \"none\"} onValueChange={v => setValue(v === \"none\" ?
