I understand the context:\n\n**Key Points I've noted:**\n- This is a Living Apps Dashboard Generator using React 18 + TypeScript\n- Users are non-technical, so I need to interpret vague requests and create intuitive, beautiful dashboards\n- Workflow: Design First (design_brief.md) → Then Implement (Dashboard.tsx)\n- Critical API rules for dates, applookup fields, and TypeScript imports\n- Existing files shouldn't be recreated (types, services, components, app_metadata.json)\n- Deployment via `mcp__deploy_tools__deploy_to_github`\n\nI'm in read-only mode, so I can search and analyze your codebase thoroughly. I have access to:\n- Glob patterns for file searching\n- Grep for content searching\n- Read for specific files\n- Bash for read-only operations\n\nI'm ready to assist. What would you like me to help you with? Whether it's:\n- Analyzing the current codebase structure\n- Understanding existing dashboards\n- Exploring app_metadata.json to understand available data\n- Finding specific components or services\n- Or anything else related to your project\n\nJust let me know what you need!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1573,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXJjKADTDrDHZf15HnhHF","type":"assistant","uuid":"158e0126-78ba-459e-bf5b-56c020d0ba75","timestamp":"2026-01-20T13:44:46.357Z"}
