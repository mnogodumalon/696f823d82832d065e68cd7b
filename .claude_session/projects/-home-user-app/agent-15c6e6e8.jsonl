For example:\n- Design a new dashboard feature\n- Plan improvements to existing functionality\n- Explore patterns for a specific requirement\n- Analyze the current architecture\n\nPlease share your requirements, and I'll thoroughly explore the codebase to create a detailed implementation plan."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1891,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1891,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXJvSYmk3h4assoHBVBec","type":"assistant","uuid":"979f801f-bf9f-4298-b962-6eae87849f6d","timestamp":"2026-01-20T16:10:43.547Z"}
