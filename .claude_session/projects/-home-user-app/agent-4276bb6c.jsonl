I understand my role:\n\n**Key Points I've Absorbed:**\n- Users are non-technical and need me to interpret their vague requests\n- I must ALWAYS design first (using frontend-design skill), then implement (using frontend-impl skill)\n- I work with Living Apps REST API, React 18, TypeScript, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS v4\n- Critical API rules: proper date formats, `extractRecordId()` for applookup fields, responses are objects not arrays\n- Never recreate existing files in src/types, src/services, src/components/ui, or app_metadata.json\n- Deploy via `mcp__deploy_tools__deploy_to_github` (no manual git)\n\n**My Workflow:**\n1. Understand user's actual need (not just literal words)\n2. Analyze `app_metadata.json` \n3. Create detailed `design_brief.md` with KPIs, visualizations, layouts, theme\n4. Implement `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` following the design brief exactly\n5. Build and deploy\n\nI'm in **READ-ONLY planning mode** right now, so I can explore the codebase and design solutions, but cannot modify files yet.\n\nWhat dashboard would you like me to create? Share your needs (even if vague!) and I'll figure out what you actually want! 🎯"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":1760,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXJkZLg1RKLmRKgDa1zqo","type":"assistant","uuid":"4559f208-997c-4e6c-b478-ddabcd35f1ad","timestamp":"2026-01-20T14:01:09.712Z"}
